# House Price Predictor 🏠
A machine learning solution to predict residential real estate prices using Linear Regression.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate house prices based on physical attributes (square footage, number of rooms, etc.). This is part of my **AI Engineering Portfolio**, demonstrating end-to-end data processing and model deployment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks & PyCharm
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

## 📁 Structure
- `notebooks/`: Contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and model prototyping.
- `src/`: Production-ready Python scripts for the regression model.
- `data/`: (Local only) Dataset used for training.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/galileo-gal/linear_regression_model.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook in `notebooks/01_eda.ipynb` to see the analysis.
